            <h2>Assignment 2: KMeans Clustering Visualization Webpage</h2>
            <p>
                In this assignment, an interactive web application that demonstrates the KMeans clustering algorithm 
                using various initialization methods was created. The goal was to explore the impact of different initialization 
                strategies for the KMeans Algorithm on the clustering outcome.

            <p>
                The assignment focussed on achieveing the following goals:
                1. Using  SVD to perform dimensionality reduction on a dataset.
                2. Exploring the effect of the number of dimensions on the performance of a classifier,
                3. Visualizing the results for comparison and analysis.

            <h2>Assignment 4: Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) Search Engine Webpage</h2>
            <p>
                In this assignment, I built an interactive web application that demonstrates LSA implementation in a search engine.
                The search engine takes a userâ€™s query, perform LSA on a pool of documents, 
                and returns the top documents based on cosine similarity.

            <h2>Assignment 5: K-Nearest Neighbors Kaggle Competition </h2>
            <p>
                In this assignment, I implemented a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model from scratch to predict customer 
                churn for a bank. The goal was to identify customers who are likely to leave the bank based on historical 
                data and submit the predictions in a mini Kaggle competition.

        <h2>Assignment 6: Linear Regression </h2>
        <p>
            In this assignment, I explore the impact of changing parameters on linear regression. 
            The goal was to create an interactive webpage to demonstrate how modifying these parameters affects regression results, 
            especially when there is no actual relationship between X and Y. By tweaking these settings, we can observe how randomness 
            can influence the slope and intercept in a regression model.

    <h2>Assignment 7: Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals in Linear Regression </h2>
    <p>
        In this assignment, I extended my previous work from Assignment 6 to include hypothesis 
        testing and confidence intervals through simulations. I enhanced the interactive webpage to 
        allow users to perform hypothesis tests on the slope or intercept of the regression line and 
        generate confidence intervals based on simulations.

<h2>Assignment 8: Logistic Regression </h2>
<p>
    In this assignment, I explored the effect of shifting clusters in a dataset 
    on the parameters of a logistic regression model.

<h2>Assignment 9: Neural Networks </h2>
<p>
    In this assignment, I implemented and analyzed a simple neural network by visualizing its learned features,
    decision boundary and gradients. The goal was to develop a deeper understanding of how a Feedforward Neural Network with 
    one hidden layer operates and represents the input space during learning.
