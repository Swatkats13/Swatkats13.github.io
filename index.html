        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my personal website! 
            I am Srishti, a second-year master's student pursuing Artificial Intelligence at Boston University.
            My professional background spans across insurance underwriting, advertising and publishing verticals. With a foundation in Computer Science
            and a master's degree in Business Administration, I have chosen to pursue AI academically to strengthen my understanding of this transformative technology.
            Driven by the pervasive impact of AI, I am particularly interested in applying AI techniques, 
            such as Computer Vision, within the Medical Imaging domain. As I prepare for a career as an AI engineer, I am committed to ensuring that the 
            algorithms I develop are not only effective but also ethical and transparent. Therefore, AI Ethics and Explainability 
            are areas that are especially significant to me as I strive to contribute to the responsible advancement of this field. </p>
