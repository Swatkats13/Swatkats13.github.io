        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>Here are some of the projects I am currently working on</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Project 1</strong><br><br> 
                
                <i>Development of Assistive Technology for Individuals with Motor Impairments Using Computer Vision</i><br>
                
                I am working on designing and implementing innovative assistive technology solutions tailored for individuals with motor impairments. 
                This project leverages advanced computer vision techniques to create applications that can interpret visual inputs and translate them 
                into actionable commands. The goal is to enhance the independence and quality of life for people with limited mobility by enabling more 
                intuitive and accessible human-computer interactions. The solution involves real-time tracking and gesture recognition, ensuring accuracy and 
                responsiveness in various environments and use cases.<br><br>  
            <li><strong>Project 2</strong> <br><br>
                
                <i>Development of AI Models to Augment Radiologists' Interpretation of Ultrasound Imaging</i><br>

                I am developing AI models designed to augment the diagnostic capabilities of radiologists, specifically in the interpretation of ultrasound studies. 
                This project focuses on creating machine learning algorithms that can accurately identify and classify patterns in ultrasound images, 
                providing reliable second opinions or pre-screening results to support radiologists in clinical decision-making. 
                By automating routine analysis and highlighting potential anomalies, these AI models aim to improve diagnostic accuracy, reduce workload, and enhance overall patient care. 
                This work is critical in advancing the integration of AI into medical imaging and supporting radiologists in delivering more precise and timely diagnoses.
