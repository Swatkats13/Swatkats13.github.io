    <h2>Project 0: Token-by-Token Text Generation using GPT-2</h2>
    <p>
        This project demonstrates how large language models like GPT-2 generate text one token at a time. 
        I explored how the model calculates the probability distribution for the next token based on the input 
        sequence, then selected the most likely token to extend the text step-by-step. The project also showcases 
        the difference between manual generation and the built-in generate() method provided by HuggingFace's 
        Transformers library.
    </p>
    <p>
        Key concepts include: Subword Tokenization (Byte Pair Encoding in GPT-2), Logits to Probabilities with Softmax, Argmax-based sampling, Autoregressive Text Generation,
        Comparison between manual generation and generate() method

    <h2>Project 1: Classification of Handwritten Digits using MLP</h2>
    <p>
        In this project, I trained a <strong>Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)</strong> to classify handwritten digits from the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database" target="_blank">MNIST dataset</a>. 
        The MNIST dataset consists of 28×28 grayscale images of digits from 0 to 9, and the goal was to correctly classify each image into one of 10 digit classes.
        Using the <code>MLPClassifier</code> from <code>scikit-learn</code>, I built and trained a simple neural network with one hidden layer. 
        The model was evaluated on a separate test set and achieved high classification accuracy. The project also includes visualization of predictions, comparing true vs. predicted labels, with color-coded highlights to spot misclassified examples—an important step for model debugging.

    </p>
    <p>
        Key concepts include: Loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset using <code>fetch_openml</code>, Training a neural network using <code>MLPClassifier</code>,
            Evaluating classification performance on train and test sets, Visualizing correct and incorrect predictions

            <h2>Project 3: Singular Value Decomposition(SVD) Implementation</h2>
            <p>
                The project focussed on achieveing the following goals:
                1. Using  SVD to perform dimensionality reduction on a dataset.
                2. Exploring the effect of the number of dimensions on the performance of a classifier,
                3. Visualizing the results for comparison and analysis.

            <h2>Project 4: Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) Search Engine Webpage</h2>
            <p>
                In this project, I built an interactive web application that demonstrates LSA implementation in a search engine.
                The search engine takes a user’s query, perform LSA on a pool of documents, 
                and returns the top documents based on cosine similarity.

            <h2>Project 5: K-Nearest Neighbors Kaggle Competition </h2>
            <p>
                In this project, I implemented a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model from scratch to predict customer 
                churn for a bank. The goal was to identify customers who are likely to leave the bank based on historical 
                data and submit the predictions in a mini Kaggle competition.

        <h2>Project 6: Linear Regression </h2>
        <p>
            In this project, I explore the impact of changing parameters on linear regression. 
            The goal was to create an interactive webpage to demonstrate how modifying these parameters affects regression results, 
            especially when there is no actual relationship between X and Y. By tweaking these settings, we can observe how randomness 
            can influence the slope and intercept in a regression model.

    <h2>Project 7: Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals in Linear Regression </h2>
    <p>
        In this project, I extended my previous work from project 6 to include hypothesis 
        testing and confidence intervals through simulations. I enhanced the interactive webpage to 
        allow users to perform hypothesis tests on the slope or intercept of the regression line and 
        generate confidence intervals based on simulations.

<h2>Project 9: Neural Networks </h2>
<p>
    In this project, I implemented and analyzed a simple neural network by visualizing its learned features,
    decision boundary and gradients. The goal was to develop a deeper understanding of how a Feedforward Neural Network with 
    one hidden layer operates and represents the input space during learning.
